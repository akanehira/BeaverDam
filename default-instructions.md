Your task is to accurately draw rectangles for the `concept` written in red color in the top of the task page.

## Quick Instructions
1. Mark the checkbox `scalte to fit` if the video is small 
2. Draw a box accurately around the concept
3. Hit `s` to go step through frames
4. Adjust the box to keep it accurate


## Keyboard Shortcuts
- `a` step back 1 frame
- `s` step forward 1 frame
- `space` play/pause
- `d` or 'delete' to delete selected rectangle

## Detailed Instructions
1. Box should be as small as possible, and it does not need to cover the area of the person. For example, if the `concept` is 'Body_Parts_Used is Arms', box should cover only arms, not legs or other parts.
2. If you do not see the `concept` in particular frames, you do not need to draw box in those frames.
3. Draw box by yourself at least once every 5 frames.
3. You can skip frames when the location of box does not change. Dotted box will be used for those frames.
4. If the target `concept` disappears then delete the rectangle. (press 'delete' with the box selected)
