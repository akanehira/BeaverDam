Your task is to accurately draw rectangles for the `concept` (such as motion or object) written in red color in the top of the task page.

## Quick Instructions
1. Mark the checkbox `scalte to fit` if the video is small 
2. Watch the whole video (Push the ▶ button), and go back to the first frame (Push the << button).
3. Draw a box accurately around the `concept`
4. Hit `s` to go step through frames
5. Adjust the box to keep it accurate. Please do not make a new box!! Just move the previous (dotted) box!!

## Keyboard Shortcuts (activated after watching video)
- `a` step back 1 frame
- `s` step forward 1 frame
- `d` or 'delete' to delete selected rectangle

## Important Details
1. Box should be as small as possible, and it does not need to cover the area of the person. For example, if the `concept` is 'Body_Parts_Used is Arms', box should cover only arms, not legs or other parts.
2. If you do not see the `concept` in particular frames, you do not need to draw box in those frames. If the target `concept` disappears then delete the rectangle. (press 'delete' with the box selected)
For example, if the `concept` is 'Motion is Flipping', start to draw box when person start to flip, and delete the box when the he stops flipping. 
3. You can skip frames when the location of box does not change. Dotted box will be used for those frames.
4. Draw box by yourself at least once every 5 frames.
5. Make sure only one box is written in the video. After finishing annotation, check it by watching video again (Push the ▶ button).
